The goal of peptideview is to visualise peptides sequences.

## Installation

You can install the development version of peptideview with:

```r
# install.package("remotes)
remotes::install_github("jeanmanguy/peptideview")
```

## Examples

### Coloured peptide sequence in the console

```{r example-simple}
library(peptideview)

peptide("KIAALKE")
```

It also works in a tibble:

```{r example-tibble}
library(peptideview)

tibble::tibble(sequences = peptide(c("KIAALKE", "KIAVLKE", "EIAALKE")))
```

(it doesn't really show here but it works in the console)

### Coloured peptide sequence htmlwidget

```{r example-htmlwidget}
library(peptideview)

view_peptide("KIAALKE")
```
